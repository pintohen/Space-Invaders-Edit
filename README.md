# Space Invaders Edit #
## By Henrique Pinto ##

This is a Space Invaders clone made in Python using Pygame, except the spaceships don't shoot, they just come into your direction.
If you let them touch you or touch the bottom of the screen, you lose.
If you reach 100 points, you win.

## How to play ##

- You can move the spaceship with the arrow keys, and shoot with the space bar.
- You can also shoot with the mouse, but it's not recommended.
- If you press up or down, the volume will change.

## How to run ##

- You need Python installed on your computer.
- You also need Pygame installed.
- Then, just run the file `main.py` with Python (python "path"/main.py).
- Or if you have the IDE PyCharm, just open the project and run it on the run button.

## How to install Pygame ##

- If you have pip installed, just run `pip install pygame` on your terminal.
- If you don't have pip, just install it and then run `pip install pygame`.
- If you don't want to install pip, you can also install Pygame manually by downloading it from [here](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) and then running `python setup.py install` on the folder where you downloaded it.
